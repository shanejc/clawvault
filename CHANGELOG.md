# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Typed memory graph index** (`.clawvault/graph-index.json`) with schema versioning and incremental rebuild support.
- **Graph-aware context retrieval** for `clawvault context`:
  - blends semantic search with graph-neighbor context,
  - includes explain signals/rationale in JSON output.
- **`clawvault compat`** command for OpenClaw compatibility diagnostics.
- **`clawvault graph`** command for graph summary/refresh diagnostics.
- **Context profiles** for `clawvault context`:
  - `default`, `planning`, `incident`, `handoff`.
- **CLI command registration smoke tests** for modular command groups.
- **Expanded CLI registration smoke coverage** across maintenance/resilience/session-lifecycle/template modules, including duplicate-command detection.
- **CLI help contract tests** to lock command/option surface (including `context --profile auto` and `compat --strict`).
- **CLI runtime helper tests** covering shared vault resolution and qmd missing-binary error mapping.
- Runtime helper coverage now also validates qmd non-zero exit propagation and consistent qmd-missing user guidance output.
- CLI test harness now uses shared fixture helpers to reduce duplicated stubs and keep command-surface contract tests maintainable.
- Doctor now includes an **OpenClaw compatibility** check summary.
- Dashboard graph parser now emits:
  - typed nodes,
  - typed edges (`wiki_link`, `tag`, `frontmatter_relation`),
  - edge/node type statistics.

### Changed
- Dashboard edge diffing now includes edge type/label, enabling reliable live updates when relation type changes.
- Hook event matching now supports alias payload shapes (`event`, `eventName`, etc.) for better OpenClaw compatibility.
- `link` and `entities` commands now consistently respect `--vault` without requiring `CLAWVAULT_PATH`.
- Memory graph index now auto-refreshes on vault writes/reindex and link mutations, reducing stale graph context.
- `doctor` and `status` now report memory graph index presence/staleness to aid long-running agent hygiene.
- Dashboard now validates graph-index freshness before reuse, automatically falling back to markdown parsing when stale.
- CLI command registration is being modularized (`core`, `maintenance`, `template`, `resilience`, `session-lifecycle`, `vault-operations`, `query`) to improve maintainability.
- Hook `session:start` context injection now infers `context --profile` from prompt intent (incident/planning/handoff/default).
- `context --profile auto` now uses centralized intent inference, and hooks delegate profile selection through this shared path.
- Library API now exports context profile inference helpers for external integrations (`inferContextProfile`, `resolveContextProfile`).
- Main CLI now uses shared vault path resolution from the config library, reducing drift between command entrypoint and command modules.
- Config resolver test coverage now includes env-vs-discovery precedence and explicit missing-vault failure behavior.
- `clawvault compat --strict` now exits non-zero on warnings/errors for CI-friendly OpenClaw compatibility gates.
- CLI entrypoint runtime helpers (`getVault`, `runQmd`, qmd-missing handling) were extracted into a dedicated module to keep command bootstrap maintainable.
- Compatibility diagnostics now also validate hook manifest required bins metadata and hook handler delegation to `context --profile auto`.
- `compat` command now supports `--base-dir` to validate alternate project roots (used for fixture and CI contract checks).
- Added compatibility fixture matrix runner (`npm run test:compat-fixtures`) with healthy and drifted OpenClaw integration fixtures.
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow running typecheck, tests, and compatibility fixture matrix.
- Added consolidated `npm run ci` local gate and wired CI workflow to use it for parity with local validation.
- Compatibility fixture matrix now validates additional hard-failure drift cases (missing required hook events, missing package hook registration) and asserts JSON report shape/signals.
- Compatibility fixture matrix expectations are now declarative via `tests/compat-fixtures/cases.json` for easier extension.
- Compatibility unit tests now assert command diagnostics against the declarative fixture expectations to keep CLI and fixture runner semantics aligned.
- Fixture matrix runner now validates required fixture file layout before execution to fail fast on malformed compatibility fixtures.
- Fixture matrix runner now supports `COMPAT_CASES` filtering for targeted local debugging of specific compatibility drift scenarios.
- Fixture matrix runner can now emit per-case JSON reports (`COMPAT_REPORT_DIR`) for CI failure triage and artifact upload.
- Compatibility fixture runner internals were extracted into reusable utilities with dedicated unit tests (schema selection/parsing/layout guards) to improve maintainability.
- Added `tests/compat-fixtures/README.md` documenting fixture layout and scenario intent for easier extension/review.
- Compatibility fixture runner now emits `summary.json` alongside per-case reports for faster CI artifact triage.
- Compatibility fixture manifest now includes explicit `schemaVersion` validation to make contract changes intentional and reviewable.
- Compatibility unit tests now assert expected diagnostic detail substrings from declarative cases, not only status/count outputs.
- Added `npm run test:compat-smoke` for fast healthy-fixture compatibility checks during local iteration.
- Compatibility fixture matrix now covers missing `SKILL.md` OpenClaw metadata as an explicit warning-drift scenario.
- Compatibility fixture matrix now also covers unsafe hook handler conventions (`execSync` and missing `--profile auto` delegation) as warning-drift scenarios.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Entity-slug routing** — People/project observations now route to entity subfolders (`people/pedro/2026-02-12.md` instead of `people/2026-02-12.md`)
- **Root-level file prevention** — Observations never create files at vault root; always route to category folders
- **Entity name extraction** — Case-sensitive proper noun matching prevents capturing common words as entity names
- **Dedup improvements** — Router uses normalized content + Jaccard similarity to prevent duplicate entries

### Changed
- Router `appendToCategory` now resolves entity-aware file paths for people and projects categories
- Updated router tests to validate entity-slug subfolder structure

---

## [1.11.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Compressor priority enforcement** — Post-processes LLM output to upgrade misclassified priorities (decisions→🔴, preferences→🟡)
- **Temporal decay in reflector** — 🟢 observations older than 7 days auto-pruned; 🔴 always kept
- **Exec summary in wake** — Wake command now shows richer context with observation summaries
- **Dedup normalization** — Strips timestamps, wiki-links, and whitespace before comparing for duplicates

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-11

### Removed

- All cloud-related dependencies and imports stripped

### Philosophy
- ClawVault is now fully local-first. Zero network calls except optional LLM API for observe compression.
- Local folder sync (`vault.sync()`) remains for Obsidian cross-platform workflows.

---

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Path validation** - OPENCLAW_HOME and OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR now properly validated (trimmed, require absolute paths)
- **Error handling** - `listAgents()` now wrapped in try/catch to handle malformed filesystem state gracefully

---

- Session transcript reading benefits from OpenClaw's parentId chain fix (#12283)

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-06

### Security
- **Fixed shell injection vulnerability** in hooks/clawvault/handler.js
  - Changed from `execSync` (with shell) to `execFileSync` (no shell)
  - All arguments passed as array, never interpolated into shell string
  - Vault path validation: must be absolute, exist, and contain .clawvault.json

- **Fixed prompt injection vulnerability**
  - Checkpoint recovery data now sanitized before injection
  - Control characters stripped, markdown escaped, length limited
  - Session keys and command sources sanitized with strict allowlist

- **Removed direct GitHub dependency** for qmd
  - qmd moved to optional peer dependency
  - Users install separately: `npm install -g github:tobi/qmd`
  - ClawVault gracefully handles missing qmd

### Changed
- Hook now validates vault paths before use
- Error messages in hooks are now generic (no sensitive data leaked)

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **`clawvault repair-session`** - Repair corrupted OpenClaw session transcripts
  - Detects orphaned `tool_result` blocks that reference non-existent `tool_use` IDs
  - Identifies aborted tool calls with partial JSON
  - Automatically relinks parent chain after removals
  - Creates backup before repair (configurable with `--no-backup`)
  - Dry-run mode with `--dry-run` to preview repairs
  - List sessions with `--list` flag
  - JSON output with `--json` for scripting
  
  **Problem solved:** When the Anthropic API rejects with "unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks", this command fixes the transcript so the session can continue without losing context.
  
  ```bash
  # Analyze without changing
  clawvault repair-session --dry-run
  
  # Repair current main session
  clawvault repair-session
  
  # Repair specific session
  clawvault repair-session --session <id> --agent <agent-id>
  ```

- **Session utilities** (`src/lib/session-utils.ts`)
  - `listAgents()` - Find all agents in ~/.openclaw/agents/
  - `findMainSession()` - Get current session for an agent
  - `findSessionById()` - Look up specific session
  - `getSessionFilePath()`, `backupSession()` - File helpers

### Tests
- Added 13 tests for session repair functionality
  - Transcript parsing
  - Tool use extraction from assistant messages
  - Corruption detection (aborted + orphaned)
  - Parent chain relinking
  - Dry-run mode
  - Backup creation

---

  - Creates handoff with: --next, --blocked, --decisions, --questions, --feeling
  - Clears death flag
  - Optional git commit prompt (--no-git to skip)
  - Captures rich context before ending session
