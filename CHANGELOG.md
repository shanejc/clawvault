# Changelog

## [2.4.0] — 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Brain Architecture Canvas** — `clawvault canvas --template brain` generates a 4-quadrant system overview:
  - **Hippocampus** (top-left): vault structure with category card grid, content flow pipeline (Session → Observe → Score → Route → Store → Reflect)
  - **Direction** (top-right): vault stats, recent decisions, open loops
  - **Agent Workspace** (bottom-left): 3-column task triage — active, blocked, backlog with owner tags and priority icons
  - **Knowledge Graph** (bottom-right): node/edge stats, most-connected entities, category breakdown with bar charts
- **Owner-Centric Project Board** — `clawvault canvas --template project-board` redesigned with:
  - Status columns (Open / In Progress / Blocked / Done) with priority icons (🔴🟠🟡)
  - Owner cards distinguishing agents (🤖) from humans (👤) with per-owner task distribution
  - Backlog section grouped by project
  - Blocked-by edges connecting dependent tasks
- **Canvas Customization Flags**:
  - `--owner <name>` — filter tasks by owner (agent or human)
  - `--width <px>` / `--height <px>` — canvas dimensions
  - `--include-done` — include completed tasks
- **Setup Command Overhaul** — `clawvault setup` now configurable:
  - `--theme neural|minimal|none` — graph color themes with Obsidian CSS snippets and colorGroups
  - `--graph-colors` / `--no-graph-colors` — opt in/out of graph theming
  - `--bases` / `--no-bases` — opt in/out of Obsidian Bases task views
  - `--canvas [template]` — generate a canvas dashboard during setup
  - `--force` — overwrite existing configuration files
  - `-v, --vault <path>` — target a specific vault

  - `--no-graph` — skip initial graph build
  - `--categories <list>` — comma-separated custom categories
  - `--canvas <template>` — generate canvas on init
  - `--theme neural|minimal|none` — graph color theme
  - `--minimal` — bare-bones vault (memory categories only)
- **Neural Graph Theme** — dark background (#0a0a0a), colored nodes by category/tag (cyan people, green projects, orange decisions, yellow lessons, red commitments), green neural-network links, golden glow on focused nodes
- **Obsidian Bases Views** — auto-generated on `setup` and `init`:
  - `all-tasks.base` — table + card views grouped by status
  - `blocked.base` — blocked tasks with days-blocked formula
  - `by-project.base` — tasks grouped by project
  - `by-owner.base` — tasks grouped by owner (agent or human)
  - `backlog.base` — backlog items by source and project

### Fixed
- Date handling for bare dates in frontmatter (e.g., `2026-02-14` without time) — `blocked`, `backlog list`, and canvas templates no longer crash on Date objects from gray-matter
- Canvas template descriptions no longer reference competitor products

### Changed
- Default setup theme is now `neural` (was unconfigured)
- Brain canvas template generates 37-50 nodes with architecture-style grouped layout (was radial)

- **Graph-Aware Context** — `clawvault context` now blends semantic search with graph-neighbor traversal, with explain signals in JSON output.
- **Context Profiles** — `clawvault context --profile <name>` with `default`, `planning`, `incident`, `handoff` presets for task-appropriate context injection.

- **367+ tests** across core, commands, graph, dashboard, hooks, and CLI registration.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Entity-slug routing** — People/project observations now route to entity subfolders (`people/pedro/2026-02-12.md` instead of `people/2026-02-12.md`)
- **Root-level file prevention** — Observations never create files at vault root; always route to category folders
- **Entity name extraction** — Case-sensitive proper noun matching prevents capturing common words as entity names
- **Dedup improvements** — Router uses normalized content + Jaccard similarity to prevent duplicate entries

### Changed
- Router `appendToCategory` now resolves entity-aware file paths for people and projects categories
- Updated router tests to validate entity-slug subfolder structure

---

## [1.11.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Compressor priority enforcement** — Post-processes LLM output to upgrade misclassified priorities (decisions→🔴, preferences→🟡)
- **Temporal decay in reflector** — 🟢 observations older than 7 days auto-pruned; 🔴 always kept
- **Exec summary in wake** — Wake command now shows richer context with observation summaries
- **Dedup normalization** — Strips timestamps, wiki-links, and whitespace before comparing for duplicates

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-11

### Removed
- **Cloud sync** — Removed entire `src/cloud/` module (client, config, queue, service, types)
- **`clawvault cloud` command** — Removed cloud sync CLI command
- All cloud-related dependencies and imports stripped

### Philosophy
- ClawVault is now fully local-first. Zero network calls except optional LLM API for observe compression.
- Local folder sync (`vault.sync()`) remains for Obsidian cross-platform workflows.

---

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Path validation** - OPENCLAW_HOME and OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR now properly validated (trimmed, require absolute paths)
- **Error handling** - `listAgents()` now wrapped in try/catch to handle malformed filesystem state gracefully

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-09

- **OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR support** - Also supports `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` for overriding state/agent paths

### Compatibility
- Verified compatibility with OpenClaw v2026.2.9

- Session transcript reading benefits from OpenClaw's parentId chain fix (#12283)

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-06

### Security
- **Fixed shell injection vulnerability** in hooks/clawvault/handler.js
  - Changed from `execSync` (with shell) to `execFileSync` (no shell)
  - All arguments passed as array, never interpolated into shell string
  - Vault path validation: must be absolute, exist, and contain .clawvault.json

- **Fixed prompt injection vulnerability**
  - Checkpoint recovery data now sanitized before injection
  - Control characters stripped, markdown escaped, length limited
  - Session keys and command sources sanitized with strict allowlist

- **Removed direct GitHub dependency** for qmd
  - qmd moved to optional peer dependency
  - Users install separately: `npm install -g github:tobi/qmd`
  - ClawVault gracefully handles missing qmd

### Changed
- Hook now validates vault paths before use
- Error messages in hooks are now generic (no sensitive data leaked)

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **`clawvault repair-session`** - Repair corrupted OpenClaw session transcripts
  - Detects orphaned `tool_result` blocks that reference non-existent `tool_use` IDs
  - Identifies aborted tool calls with partial JSON
  - Automatically relinks parent chain after removals
  - Creates backup before repair (configurable with `--no-backup`)
  - Dry-run mode with `--dry-run` to preview repairs
  - List sessions with `--list` flag
  - JSON output with `--json` for scripting
  
  **Problem solved:** When the Anthropic API rejects with "unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks", this command fixes the transcript so the session can continue without losing context.
  
  ```bash
  # Analyze without changing
  clawvault repair-session --dry-run
  
  # Repair current main session
  clawvault repair-session
  
  # Repair specific session
  clawvault repair-session --session <id> --agent <agent-id>
  ```

- **Session utilities** (`src/lib/session-utils.ts`)
  - `listAgents()` - Find all agents in ~/.openclaw/agents/
  - `findMainSession()` - Get current session for an agent
  - `findSessionById()` - Look up specific session
  - `getSessionFilePath()`, `backupSession()` - File helpers

### Tests
- Added 13 tests for session repair functionality
  - Transcript parsing
  - Tool use extraction from assistant messages
  - Corruption detection (aborted + orphaned)
  - Parent chain relinking
  - Dry-run mode
  - Backup creation

---
