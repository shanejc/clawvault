### Changed
- Added README governance contracts for compatibility automation docs: CI artifact-list documentation is now required to match canonical upload-artifact contract order/domain, and required compatibility stack command references are now drift-checked from centralized script-reference contracts.
- CI workflow contract domain constants now include job-keyed field/scalar/step sequence maps, and parser utilities now expose reusable multi-job snapshot builders so governance can scale to future matrix/multi-job workflows without duplicating assertion logic.
- README compatibility command-reference governance now enforces exact-once canonical command lines for required stack/documentation entrypoints, preventing duplicate or missing contract command guidance drift.
- CI workflow contract enforcement now validates required job-level unique field occurrences and required step ordering/uniqueness through job-keyed sequence maps, making multi-job expansion contract checks reusable without single-job assumptions.
- Workflow job snapshot utilities now auto-discover top-level job names when explicit job lists are omitted, with regression coverage to keep multi-job contract extraction reusable for future CI topology expansion.
- CI workflow contract suites now exercise discovered-job snapshot extraction directly against the live workflow file, ensuring auto-discovery remains aligned with canonical required job domains.

- Upload-artifact path extraction helpers now support both multiline scalar and YAML list-style `with.path` forms, with regression tests to prevent parser drift across equivalent workflow encodings.
- CI workflow parser internals now expose a reusable nested section list/multiline field extractor used by upload-path parsing, reducing format-specific logic duplication and adding scalar/list/multiline path regression coverage.
- Live CI workflow contract assertions now verify nested path-field extraction parity through both specialized and generic nested-field helpers for summary/failure upload steps, protecting real-workflow wiring from helper drift.

- Npm script-stack contract checks now build a transitive reachable npm-run graph from required stack sources and enforce both resolvability and cycle-safety across that graph, improving protection against nested script wiring regressions.
- Npm script-stack graph parsing/traversal logic is now centralized in shared helpers (`compat-npm-script-graph-utils`) with dedicated unit coverage, reducing duplicate regex/graph logic in stack-contract tests and making future script-governance checks easier to extend safely.
- Added `test:compat-script-stack-contract:fast` and wired it into `test:compat-summary:fast`, so fast compatibility flows now enforce npm-script stack wiring contracts before fixture/schema validators run.
- Npm script-stack contract constants now also encode required CI-reachable compat script domain, and stack-contract tests assert those scripts are reachable from `ci` via the transitive npm-run graph, tightening end-to-end workflow wiring guarantees.
- Stack-order contract checks now require each sequence segment to appear exactly once (not merely in order), preventing duplicate-step regressions in fast/CI compatibility script chains.
- Added explicit producer/consumer ordering contracts for compatibility artifact scripts (e.g. `*:verify:report` before corresponding `*:verify:schema`), with dedicated stack-contract assertions that fail on missing, reordered, or duplicated producer/consumer segments.
- Added CI workflow contract governance tests that parse `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and enforce both the canonical primary run command (`npm run ci`) and canonical compat artifact upload file list/order for the `compat-summary` artifact step.
- CI workflow contract governance now also enforces canonical `COMPAT_REPORT_DIR` binding for the primary CI run step plus canonical upload-step metadata (`name: compat-summary`, `if-no-files-found: ignore`), tightening parity between produced report location and uploaded artifact contracts.
- CI workflow contract governance now also validates the failure-only compat report upload step (`if: failure()`), including canonical artifact metadata (`name: compat-reports`), upload path parity (`${{ runner.temp }}/compat-reports`), and `if-no-files-found` handling.
- CI workflow governance contracts now also encode/validate foundational environment wiring for `Checkout`, `Setup Node`, and `Install dependencies` steps (action pins, Node/cache settings, and `npm ci` install command), reducing drift risk in baseline CI runtime setup.
- Added explicit CI step-sequence contract assertions for the test-and-compat workflow path (`Checkout → Setup Node → Install dependencies → Run quality and compatibility checks → failure upload → summary upload`), catching accidental reordering before runtime failures occur.
- Extracted reusable CI workflow parsing helpers into `compat-ci-workflow-test-utils` and added dedicated unit coverage, reducing duplicate workflow-string parsing logic across contract suites and making future CI governance checks easier to extend safely.
- CI workflow parser utilities now also support job-level extraction (`extractJobMetadata`/`extractJobBlock`) with dedicated unit coverage for job boundary handling, enabling contract checks to be scoped to explicit workflow jobs rather than global YAML scans.
- CI workflow contracts now enforce canonical job-level runtime envelope for the compat job (`test-and-compat`, `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`, `timeout-minutes: 15`), reducing drift risk in foundational CI execution characteristics.
- Step-order and step-content contract assertions now evaluate within the canonical compat job block, tightening guarantees that required steps are present and ordered in the intended job context (not merely elsewhere in workflow YAML).
- CI workflow contracts now also enforce uniqueness for each required compat-job step, catching duplicate-step regressions that could previously pass presence/order-only checks.
- CI workflow upload-step governance now also validates canonical `if` expressions and `uses` action pins for both summary and failure upload steps (`always()`/`failure()`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`), tightening artifact-publication contract integrity.
- CI workflow parser utilities now include generic job/field occurrence counters (`countJobNameOccurrences`, `countScalarFieldOccurrences`) with dedicated unit coverage, enabling stricter uniqueness governance for job declarations and key job-level fields.

- CI workflow contracts now enforce canonical top-level workflow identity/shape (`name`, `on`, `jobs` uniqueness + `name: CI`) and trigger domain parity (push branches `main`/`master`/`cursor/**` plus `pull_request` trigger), reducing drift risk in CI invocation boundaries.
- CI workflow parser utilities now also expose explicit trigger-name extraction (`extractOnTriggerNames`) and top-level/job-field occurrence primitives, enabling stricter domain and uniqueness checks for workflow invocation contracts.

- Canonical top-level CI job-name domain is now centralized via `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_JOB_NAMES` and validated by both constants and workflow-contract suites, tightening drift detection for workflow job-surface changes.
- CI workflow parser utilities now also expose step-domain extraction (`extractStepNames`), and compat workflow contracts assert exact step-name domain parity for the canonical compat job (not only required-step presence/order), closing drift gaps from unexpected extra step insertions.
- Canonical CI step-name domain is now centralized via `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_STEP_NAMES` and enforced to match required step sequence contracts, tightening governance consistency between static constants and workflow-level assertions.
- CI workflow parser utilities now also expose step top-level field-domain extraction/counting (`extractStepFieldNames`, `countStepFieldOccurrences`) with utility coverage, enabling stricter per-step shape governance.
- CI workflow contracts now enforce exact top-level field-name domain per required compat-job step (e.g. checkout=`name+uses`, setup-node=`name+uses+with`, run-step=`name+run+env`, upload steps=`name+if+uses+with`), reducing drift risk from silent step-shape mutations.
- Canonical per-step field-name domains are now centralized in `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_STEP_FIELD_NAME_SEQUENCES`, keeping constants/tests/workflow assertions aligned under a single source of truth.
- CI workflow parser utilities now also support nested section field-domain extraction (`extractNestedSectionFieldNames`) for step sub-blocks such as `with` and `env`, with dedicated utility coverage for both populated and missing-section paths.
- CI workflow contracts now enforce exact nested field-name domains for required `with`/`env` sections (e.g. setup-node with=`node-version+cache`, upload with=`name+path+if-no-files-found`, run-step env=`COMPAT_REPORT_DIR`), tightening protection against silent nested-shape drift.
- Canonical nested step-section domains are now centralized in `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_STEP_WITH_FIELD_NAME_SEQUENCES` and `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_STEP_ENV_FIELD_NAME_SEQUENCES`, keeping step-shape governance fully declarative and aligned across constants + tests.
- CI workflow parser utilities now also expose workflow/job top-level field-domain extraction helpers (`extractTopLevelFieldNames`, `extractJobTopLevelFieldNames`), and workflow contracts enforce exact top-level field-name parity for both workflow and compat-job envelopes.
- Canonical workflow/job top-level field-name domains are now centralized in `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_WORKFLOW_FIELD_NAMES` and `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_JOB_FIELD_NAMES`, keeping domain-governance contracts explicit and aligned with existing uniqueness checks.
- CI workflow parser utilities now also expose a normalized cross-surface snapshot builder (`buildWorkflowContractSnapshot`) plus additional step-domain extraction primitives (`extractStepFieldNames`, `extractNestedSectionFieldNames`), improving reuse of workflow-shape parsing logic across governance suites.
- Added holistic workflow contract snapshot assertions covering workflow identity, trigger domain, job envelope, step domain, and nested step section fields in one normalized contract comparison, reducing drift-check fragmentation while preserving strict invariants.
- CI workflow parser utilities now also support nested scalar-value extraction for step sections (`extractNestedSectionScalarFieldValue`) and workflow/job top-level field-domain extraction (`extractTopLevelFieldNames`, `extractJobTopLevelFieldNames`) with expanded utility coverage.
- CI workflow contracts now enforce canonical scalar value contracts across top-level step fields and nested `with`/`env` sections, and verify exact workflow/job top-level field domains, tightening protection against silent value/shape drift in CI execution/configuration surfaces.
- Canonical scalar/value-domain contracts are now centralized in `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_STEP_TOP_LEVEL_SCALAR_VALUE_CONTRACTS`, `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_STEP_WITH_SCALAR_VALUE_CONTRACTS`, and `REQUIRED_COMPAT_CI_STEP_ENV_SCALAR_VALUE_CONTRACTS`, improving maintainability of CI governance metadata.
- CI workflow governance now includes a normalized snapshot helper (`buildWorkflowContractSnapshot`) that captures workflow triggers, job envelope, step domains, and nested section domains in one parsed structure, reducing parser duplication across contract assertions.
- Added consolidated snapshot-based CI contract assertions that compare normalized parsed workflow structure against canonical contract constants in a single high-signal check, complementing granular assertions while improving maintainability and drift-detection clarity.
- Script-stack contract checks for `test:compat-script-stack-contract:fast` and `test:compat-artifact-cli-drift:fast` now require each required test path segment exactly once (not just present), catching duplicate suite-wiring regressions in fast governance gates.
- Npm stack-contract governance now centralizes canonical `npm run` target domains for artifact/report/validator/summary/ci stack sequences and asserts exact extracted run-target parity from `package.json` scripts, closing drift gaps where extra or reordered run-target references could bypass substring-only sequence checks.
- CI workflow contract parser utilities now use indentation-aware block boundary extraction for jobs/steps (instead of fixed `\n      - name:` style delimiters), and include regression coverage proving step parsing remains correctly bounded across alternate indentation contexts.
- `test:compat-script-stack-contract:fast` now also runs CI workflow utility tests, so parser/helper regressions fail at the same early workflow-contract gate as stack/CI wiring drift checks.
- `test:compat-script-stack-contract:fast` now also runs dedicated CI workflow contract suites, ensuring workflow drift is caught by the earliest compatibility gate (including local `npm run ci` execution).
- `npm run ci` now runs `test:compat-script-stack-contract:fast` as its first gate, enabling immediate workflow-wiring contract failures before heavier typecheck/test/build stages.
- Added `test:compat-artifact-cli-drift:fast` and wired it into `test:compat-artifact-stack:fast`, ensuring artifact CLI drift-regression suites run in the fast compatibility artifact stack gate (not only in full-unit-test runs).
- Compatibility npm workflows are now modularized into composable stack scripts (`test:compat-report-stack:fast`, `test:compat-validator-stack:fast`, `test:compat-artifact-stack:fast`) so `test:compat-summary:fast` remains maintainable as contract gates grow.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-02-12

  - Dry-run mode with `--dry-run` to preview repairs
  - List sessions with `--list` flag
  - JSON output with `--json` for scripting
  
  **Problem solved:** When the Anthropic API rejects with "unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks", this command fixes the transcript so the session can continue without losing context.
  
  ```bash
  # Analyze without changing
  clawvault repair-session --dry-run
  
  # Repair current main session
  clawvault repair-session
  
  # Repair specific session
  clawvault repair-session --session <id> --agent <agent-id>
  ```
