# ClawVault 🐘

An elephant never forgets. Structured memory for OpenClaw agents.

> **Built for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)** — install via `clawhub install clawvault`

## Install

```bash
npm install -g clawvault
```

## Setup

```bash
# Initialize vault (creates folder structure + templates)
clawvault init ~/my-vault

# Or set env var to use existing vault
export CLAWVAULT_PATH=/path/to/memory
```

## Core Commands

### Store memories by type

```bash
# Types: fact, feeling, decision, lesson, commitment, preference, relationship, project
clawvault remember decision "Use Postgres over SQLite" --content "Need concurrent writes for multi-agent setup"
clawvault remember lesson "Context death is survivable" --content "Checkpoint before heavy work"
clawvault remember relationship "Justin Dukes" --content "Client contact at Hale Pet Door"
```

### Quick capture to inbox

```bash
clawvault capture "TODO: Review PR tomorrow"
```

### Search (requires qmd installed)

```bash
# Keyword search (fast)
clawvault search "client contacts"

# Semantic search (slower, more accurate)
clawvault vsearch "what did we decide about the database"
```

## Context Death Resilience

### Checkpoint (save state frequently)

```bash
clawvault checkpoint --working-on "PR review" --focus "type guards" --blocked "waiting for CI"
```

### Recover (check on wake)

```bash
clawvault recover --clear
# Shows: death time, last checkpoint, recent handoff
```

### Handoff (before session end)

```bash
clawvault handoff \
  --working-on "ClawVault improvements" \
  --blocked "npm token" \
  --next "publish to npm, create skill" \
  --feeling "productive"
```

### Recap (bootstrap new session)

```bash
clawvault recap
# Shows: recent handoffs, active projects, pending commitments, lessons
```

## Auto-linking

Wiki-link entity mentions in markdown files:

```bash
# Link all files
clawvault link --all

# Link single file
clawvault link memory/2024-01-15.md
```

## Folder Structure

```
vault/
├── .clawvault/           # Internal state
│   ├── last-checkpoint.json
│   └── dirty-death.flag
├── decisions/            # Key choices with reasoning
├── lessons/              # Insights and patterns
├── people/               # One file per person
├── projects/             # Active work tracking
├── handoffs/             # Session continuity
├── inbox/                # Quick captures
└── templates/            # Document templates
```

## Best Practices

1. **Checkpoint every 10-15 min** during heavy work
2. **Handoff before session end** — future you will thank you
3. **Recover on wake** — check if last session died
4. **Use types** — knowing WHAT you're storing helps WHERE to put it
5. **Wiki-link liberally** — `[[person-name]]` builds your knowledge graph

## Integration with qmd

ClawVault uses [qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) for search:

```bash
# Install qmd
bun install -g github:tobi/qmd

# Add vault as collection
qmd collection add /path/to/vault --name my-memory --mask "**/*.md"

# Update index
qmd update && qmd embed
```

## Environment Variables

- `CLAWVAULT_PATH` — Default vault path (skips auto-discovery)
